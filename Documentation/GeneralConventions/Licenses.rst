Licenses
========

Old manuals that are maintained by the TYPO3 documentation team usually
have the http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/ license.
We keep that until something else may be decided somewhere in the future.


New manuals should use a **Creative Commons license**:

**License:** `CC BY 4.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`__ (Creative Commons)
